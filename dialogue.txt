113 Wait.. what's this note doing here?
114 It says.. 
115 "HAHA MADE YOU READ !!"
116 "-MARK"
117 ...
// locked door DIALOGUES
118 Is that... an elevator?
119 It seems this gate is in the way.
120 SORRY TO READ YOUR MIND BUT YUP. THAT'S A GATE.
121 WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND A SWITCH SOMEWHERE TO OPEN IT.
122 WHY DON'T YOU INTERACT WITH MORE OF THE THINGS IN THE ROOM?
123 I SUGGEST STARTING WITH THE TABLE ON THE LEFT!
124 It's a golden key.
125 Hey Mark.. what's this for?
126 MMHF!

128 S-SORRY I WAS EATING CHICKEN.

131 ANYWAY, THAT KEY IS FOR THE ELEVATOR OVER THERE.
132 IT BRINGS YOU UP TO THE NEXT FLOOR. CLEAR 5 FLOORS AND YOU'RE FREE!
133 FROM WHAT YOU ASK?
134 YOU'LL SEE!
135 DON'T FORGET TO PICK THIS UP. BYT HE WAY, IF YOU DIE YOU'LL HAVE TO GET THIS KEY AGAIN!
136 Red is bad.. right?
// lever and elevators
137 It's a lever base.
138 Nothing happened...
139 OH THE GATE'S GONE!
140 LET'S GO TO THE NEXT FLOOR!
141 It's a puddle...
142 I shouldn't step there.
143 OH YEAH! ARE YOU TIRED OF WALKING AROUND?
144 PRESS 'SHIFT' WHILE MOVING TO SPRINT.

// FLOOR 2
200 A broken cellphone.. looks familiar...
201 Looks like it still has life in it.
202 Let me try entering a random password..
203 ..!!
204 It worked!
205 Must be my lucky da-
206 Oh. it shut off.
207 It's a golden key.
208 Mark said this was important in climbing this building.
209 This place smells a little like blood...
// garden 2_3
210 WOW! WHAT A HUGE GARDEN!
211 Garden..?
212 WELL, I GUESS IT'S MORE LIKE A MAZE OR A JUNGLE NOW. 
213 PLACE HASN'T BEEN MAINTANED IN A WHILE.
214 These are plants?
215 Why are they red...?
216 DUNNO!
217 The elevator stopped working..
218 I should move forward.
219 WELCOME TO FLOOR 2!
220 I HOPE YOU'LL GET THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS...
221 CATCH YA LATER!
// toy mech 2_3
222 Hehe, what a cute little robot, wonder what it's doing here
223 PROBABLY ABANDONED BY ITS OWNER DON'T YOU THINK?
224 I guess so, but why...
225 You flipped the switch, expecting it to move, maybe dance a bit
226 Instead, you see sparks flying and smoke rising
227 Figures
// beef stew 2_3
228 WOW, WHAT IS THAT SMELL???
229 Mmm, that smells really good
230 And it's... beef stew?! Mark you like beef stew don't you?
231 (Wait...how do I know he likes beef stew)
232 YES IT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE DISH
233 I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT WHY IT'S THE BEST DISH EVER CREATED
234 (That's strange...whatever I'll think about it later)
// grand piano 2_3
235 Woah!!! What's this giant grand piano doing here?
236 YOU NEVER KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE WILL FIND IT USEFUL
237 Hmm, I HAVE missed playing the piano
238 A few notes won't hurt now will it?
239 WOW YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS? DO YOU PRACTICE?
240 Yeah, I did for a while. Just so I can play for...
241 FOR...?
242 I don't really remember, for someone I guess.

245 What do you think?
// window_fire 2_1
246 I wonder who started this fire...
247 MAYBE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?
248 I hope
// window_lamp 2_1
249 That lamp looks really dangerous, I feel like it might explode any minute now
250 BETTER STEP A BIT FURTHER AWAY FROM IT
251 I guess so
// window_monument 2_1
252 WHAT'S THAT MOUND OF RUBBLE?
253 ...
254 That used to be a public monument
255 OF WHAT?
256 I also don't know
// first window 2_2
257 Nobody deserves this...
// second window 2_2
258 What a horrible sight...
259 May his soul find peace.
// third window 2_3
260 That's a huge bonfire.
261 But who the hell would camp here in this desolate wasteland?
// elv2
262 "So your son's condition is deteriorating, Mr. ---"
263 "I'm afraid there's nothing we can do."
264 W-Wait, is this a hospital...?
265 I need help, something happened and-
266 There's zombies... or- or something..
267 "What are you talking about?"
// FLOOR 3
301 OH HEY! YOU BEAT THE MAZE!
302 CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE OFFICIALLY AT THE HALFWAY MARK.
303 Hey... what exactly is going on?
304 NOT EXACTLY SURE MYSELF...
305 THOUGH IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING REALLY BAD :c
306 ...
307 I should keep going.
308 It's a sofa.
309 It look nice and comfy. 
310 Hm? I think...
311 I used to sit on one of these a lot with... 
312 ...my family.
313 Do I still have a family?
314 Is this a water dispenser?
315 Maybe I should take a drink.
// forced dlg 1
316 NO WAY.
317 IS THAT ANOTHER PERSON?
318 ...
319 "h-hello"
320 "are you a survivor, too?"
321 "oh my god, I thought I was the only one left!"
322 "hheeeheehee..."
323 ...?
324 Can you tell me what happened here? 
325 I just woke up a couple hours ago and nothing makes sense.
326 "ahh yes yes"
327 "after you do something for me first!"
328 "ii need you to find my green wallet somewhere in those rooms..."
329 "i just want to see my kids' pictures again.."
330 And then you'll tell me?
331 "of course i will!"
332 ...alright
333 I think something happened!
334 I need to watch out for these live wires..
335 Looks like some of them are aren't always on..
336 Looks like I found his wallet.
337 W-what...
338 These pictures...
339 This can't be right...
340 W-What just happened?
341 I'm back here huh...
342 ...
343 That man is gone too..
344 It's a bush.
345 That's it.
346 I'm a little bit scared to touch it since that red maze area...
347 "I love you honey."
348 Love you too.
349 "I'll be taking the kids to the show later right?"
350 Mhmm
351 "Okay, you have fun at the meeting."
352 Alright hone-
353 ----------hnrgh
354 W-What the hell? 
355 A memory? Was that my wife? 
356 Why can't I remember..?
357 The circuit breaker looks destroyed..
358 I guess I'll have to be careful.
// picture frame floor 4
422 A faint glint catches your eye
423 You decided to investigate where the light is coming from
424 As you get closer to the object, you start to realize what it is
425 A rectangular picture frame, finished with smooth wooden edges
426 A beam of light coming from outside, bouncing off the glass, bright enough to blind you
427 The quality of the frame amazed you, what a beautiful piece of handiwork...
428 if it weren't for the glaringly obvious crack across the glass screen
429 However, these did not catch your attention, what caught your attention...
430 was the picture itself: a family of four, smiling happily.
431 How wholesome
432 But upon closer inspection, you noticed something was off
433 All but one of the members of the picture had vague and unclear facial features
434 The only one with a clear and definite face was a tall, well-built man
435 Most probably the father of the family
436 Lost in thought, you unknowingly shifted the angle of the frame
437 Looking back down onto the frame, you see a glimpse of somethi- no, someONE
438 When the realization kicked in...
439 panic
440 Next thing you know, you're a good distance away from the picture frame,
441 which now lying facedown on the ground
442 You start to walk away, denying what you just saw
443 But it's no use, you can't simply forget about it
444 That is, seeing the tall, well-built man
